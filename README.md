# PyBer Analysis Project

## PyBer Analysis - Overview:

The purpose of the following analysis is to:
- create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, 
- create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type, and
- summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## PyBer Analysis - Results and Analysis:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt) Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

### Ride-Sharing Data per City Type:

The table below displays ride-sharing data per city type.

Urban: As expected with Ride-sharing data, the urban areas have higher numbers in the total rides, total drivers, and total fares categories, likely due to population and demand.  Also, as expected, the average fare per ride, and average fare per driver is the lowest of the three city types which could be due to more competition, shorter distances traveled, etc.

Suburban: Suburban cities fall in the middle of urban and rural cities when it comes to all categories as expected.

Rural: Rural cities have the lowest numbers when it comes to total rides, total drivers, and total fares likley due to population and demand, but the highest when it comes to average fare per ride and average fare per driver likely due to less compettion, fewer drivers, and longer distances traveled.

The following chart shows the weekly fares by city type between January and April 2019.  All city types' fares increase around 2/24/19, and the city fares have several peaks during March.  There's also a very significant increase in fares at the beginning of April (4/7/19) for rural cities.
